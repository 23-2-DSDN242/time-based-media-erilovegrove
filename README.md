I created a sketch of a window sill garden themed clock. On the left, a flower will grow a little bit every second, in the middle a watering can will fill up every minute, and on the right, a vine will bloom every hour.

Maeda clock imitation: I really challenged myself to make this clock work, and used new functions that i've never used before to sort the numbers into rows and columns.

I slightly adjusted my design to show time differently. The hours will be indicated by the 12 circles around the bigger circle. There will be numbers 0 - 59 placed on 59 flowers, where one will be highlighted depending on the minute. The seconds will be shown by the water rising in the watering can, and a water drop that will be dropping every second. I started doing some very basic coding.

I did some basic coding to make 12 circles around the bigger circle, where one would light up depending on the hour. I used maps and angles to make the time AM and PM.

With some help, I have started to code numbers 0-59 that will keep track of the minutes. Nothing pretty at the moment, still getting a feel for the code. On the right, a dark green circle falls smoothly every second into a blue rectangle that increases every second. This will be the base for my watering can idea.
